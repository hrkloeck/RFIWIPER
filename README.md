Base is first a HDF5 file from SKAMPI to understand some of the issues we encountered for uncalibrated datasets
The first test dataset is EDD_2023-05-19T05_42_23.848010UTC_yWRaJ.hdf5 and is availible via:

	ftp://ftp.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/outgoing/hrk/EDD_2023-05-19T05_42_23.848010UTC_yWRaJ.hdf5

 more to come in the future.

 The basic task is to speed up the thing!
